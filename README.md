The Linking Open Government Data (LOGD) project investigates opening and linking government data using Semantic web technologies.

This GitHub site is a very late addition to the LOGD project's effort, and will only have a minimal subset of what was done before. This repository is only being used to port some of the project from its current machine to another.
